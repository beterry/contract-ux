# About this Project

## Customer Portal

Mail Shark is an industry-leading direct mail and print company located in Mohnton, Pennsylvania. They offer many different services including unique, pay-weekly mailing programs and commercial printing. After enrolling in a program at Mail Shark, a customer gets access to an online portal where they can view contract details, upload files, and much more.

As UI/UX Designer at Mail Shark, I was assigned to redesign the customer portal UI.

## Contract UX

I developed the Contracts feature of the customer portal as a coding challenge for myself.

The Contracts feature of the customer portal allows a customer to view the list of their active and completed mailing/printing contracts (programs). The user can click on a contract in the list and view additional information, such as campaigns in a mailing program and recent weekly invoices.
