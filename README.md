## About Mail Shark’s customer portal

Mail Shark is an industry-leading direct mail and print company located in Mohnton, Pennsylvania. They offer many different services including unique, pay-weekly mailing programs and commercial printing. After enrolling in a program at Mail Shark, a customer gets access to an online portal where they can view contract details, upload files, and much more.

In 2020, redesigning the customer portal was a priority for Mail Shark's marketing department. As UI/UX Designer, I was responsible for the planning, designing, and developing the prototype for the improved customer experience. 

## Developing the prototype

Although XD has powerful prototyping features, I developed a functional prototype to more adequately show the effectiveness of the new interface.
